# module-1-challenge: code refactoring

## Background & Description

This repo contains my submission for the Module 1 Challenge.  

Module 1 covered HTML, Git, and CSS, and this challenge was designed to test my understanding of these areas as covered.

This repo hosts and displays my refactored code, along with my usage of git in deploying it.
